                <p>Over here, I display the front page of the blog I created a few years back. It also has the logo I created to display on my blog, visitation cards and also the t-shirt I was wearing while chilling.Yes indeed, I was pretty proud of myself and I wanted to show off... Too bad I went for a low quality t-shirt that was oversized and all.</p>
